# Support for Projects

The OpenJS Foundation provides support to projects as follows:

* Facilitating communication between the larger ecosystem and
  projects. This includes:
  * Bridging between Javascript Newsletters and Periodicals 

## Bridging between projects and Javacript Newsletters and Periodicals

There are a number of great newsletters and periodicals. Getting articles
into these newsletters and periodicals is one way that a project can share
key messages and news but they often don't have a good way to do this.

Further complicating things is that developers and those managing newsletters
and periodicals don't use the same set of tools regularly and so finding
a common tool/location that works for both groups may not be easy.
The OpenJS Foundation helps projects get their news to these orgnizations by:

* Providing a [news](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/news) repository
  where project contributors can open issues with news items that would
  be good to be shared in newsletters and periodicals. The expectation
  is the the person who opens the issue will craft the original info
  needed by a newletter or periodical that picks it up and will also
  be available to answer any questions.
* Providing a mailing list that those who run newsletters and periodicals
  can subscribe to.
* Periodically upating the list of organizations that are subscribed to
  the mailing list in the repo so that developers know who their news
  items are being sent to.
* Generating a weekly summary from the issues in news repo and sending
  the summary to the mailing list.
* Reviewing the most active newsletters and periodical's in the
  JavaScript ecosystem on a quarterly basis and reaching out to those
  who are not subscribed to the mailing list or directly to the repo.
